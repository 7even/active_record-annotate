# ActiveRecord::Annotate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/7even/active_record-annotate.png)](https://travis-ci.org/7even/active_record-annotate) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/7even/active_record-annotate.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/7even/active_record-annotate)

ActiveRecord::Annotate is a simple ActiveRecord plugin for annotating your rails models. It is based on `ActiveRecord::SchemaDumper` (a core ActiveRecord class responsible for creating `db/schema.rb`) so the annotation format is very close to what you write in your migrations.

## Installation

Trivial.

```ruby
# Gemfile
group :development do
  # you don't want to annotate your models in production, do you?
  gem 'active_record-annotate', '~> 0.4'
end
```

```sh
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Gem adds a simple `db:annotate` rake task - it just writes the annotation to the top of each model file in a comment block (magic encoding comment is preserved).

Once you install the gem into your application it hooks `db:annotate` to run after each `db:migrate` / `db:rollback` to keep the annotations in sync with the DB schema, but if you added a new model without migrating (or just accidentally messed up with something) you can always run the annotation process by hand:

```sh
$ rake db:annotate
```

This is what a common annotation looks like:

```ruby
# create_table :documents, force: true do |t|
#   t.string   :title
#   t.text     :content
#   t.integer  :category_ids, array: true
#   t.datetime :created_at
#   t.datetime :updated_at
# end
#
# add_index :documents, [:category_ids], name: :index_documents_on_category_ids, using: :gin

class Document < ActiveRecord::Base
# ...
```

### Configuration

The annotation process can be configured via the `ActiveRecord::Annotate.configure` block which is handy to keep in an initializer.

You can generate the basic initializer with a built-in generator:

```sh
$ rails generate active_record:annotate:install
```

It creates an initializer at `config/initializers/annotate.rb` which contains descriptive comments about each setting.

```ruby
require 'active_record/annotate'

if defined?(ActiveRecord::Annotate)
  ActiveRecord::Annotate.configure do |config|
    # # set this to true to wrap annotations in triple backticks (```)
    # # so YARD documentation can process the annotation as a code block
    # config.yard = false
    #
    # # Define any models to be skipped by Annotate
    # config.ignored_models = [SomeIgnoredModel, AnotherIgnoredModel]
  end
end
```
